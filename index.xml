These are loaded alphabetically. Then user configurations in ~/.config/regolith3/i3/config.d are loaded, also in alphabetical order. Regolith&amp;rsquo;s default configuration is built to be customized by setting Xresources variables, adding user configuration, and adding or removing default configurations via apt. For this reason, there are several approaches to customization of i3 in Regolith that can be used separately or in combination to achieve your configuration cleanly:</description></item><item><title>Install</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/install/</guid><description>Get Regolith 3.2 # If you&amp;rsquo;re upgrading from an earlier version of Regolith, you may be interested in reading the release notes and if coming from 2.x, the migration guide.

It looks like we&amp;rsquo;re getting some help from upstream, but it may be some time until we&amp;rsquo;re able to support GNOME 45-based distros if the solution ends up being that we need to implement our own portal backend to coexist with GNOME&amp;rsquo;s backend.</description></item><item><title>1.5.2 Release Notes</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.5.2-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.5.2-release-notes/</guid><description>Regolith 1.5.2 is a bug fix release.

By changing Xresources values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for some of the blocklets on the bar.
In Regolith, Xresources values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresources files, and overriding the existing Xresources values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break your customizations.</description></item><item><title>Remove Unneeded Dependencies</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/remove-unneeded-deps/</guid><description>When Regolith is installed via ISO, only the necessary desktop components or packages are installed by default. However when installing Regolith into an existing Ubuntu system, some desktop components that Regolith does not require will still be installed on the system. There is nothing wrong with keeping these additional packages, in fact they are important if you wish to switch back to the default Ubuntu session at some point, however some users prefer to remove them.</description></item><item><title>Stage Config Files</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/stage-configs/</guid><description>If you only wish to override or provide new Xresources values, staging configs is not required and not recommended. Overriding Xresources value is described in a separate article. Regolith uses a number of configuration files to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files.</description></item><item><title>Support Multiple Batteries</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/howtos/multiple-batteries/</guid><description>i3 # NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.
